# SkillSwap

SkillSwap is a **community-based skill exchange platform** where users can **offer a skill they know** and **learn a skill they want**.  
It’s designed to connect learners and professionals, making it possible to **exchange knowledge instead of money**.  
Through SkillSwap, users can meet new professionals, collaborate, and grow together by sharing their expertise.

## About The Project

If you have a skill — whether it’s web development, photography, or guitar — you can offer it to others and, in return, learn something you’re passionate about.  

This project aims to create a **community-driven ecosystem** where learning is powered by mutual exchange and collaboration rather than traditional transactions.
